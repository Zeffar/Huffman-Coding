Program that generates a Huffman Tree from a set of instructions.
data.in -> list of all of the instructions, one line = one instruction. the program will compute the frequency of each instruction
main.cpp -> main program, run the code to generate the tree and fill the .txt files
alphabet.txt -> Lookup table of the Huffman Encodings
tree.txt -> Preorder Traversal Encoding of the Huffman Tree + Lookup table of the Huffman Encodings
